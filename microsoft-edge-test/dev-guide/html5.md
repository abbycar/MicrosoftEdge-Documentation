# HTML5 features

## Audio
You can use the [HTML5 audio](./html5/audio.md) element to embed simple sound effects, background audio, or more sophisticated audio engines to your webpage without requiring script or add-on controls.

## File API
The [File  API](./html5/file-API.md) provides a means to manipulate file objects in web applications.

## Folder upload

Microsoft Edge supports [drag and drop with folders](./html5/folder-upload.md) using the same API (webkitGetAsEntry) as [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/07/Drag-and-drop-a-folder-onto-Chrome-now-available).

## Newly supported elements and attributes
Check out the latest [HTML5 elements and attributes](./html5/newly-supported-elements-and-attributes.md) supported in Microsoft Edge.

## Sandbox
The  [sandbox](./html5/sandbox.md)  attribute enables security restrictions for iframe elements that contain untrusted content. These restrictions enhance security by preventing untrusted content from performing actions that can lead to potentially malicious behavior.

## Selection API
The  [selection](./html5/selection-API.md) object represents the active selection, which is typically a highlighted block of text or other elements in the document. The active selection can be used to complete an action issued by a user or a script.

## Video
Using [HTML5 video](./html5/video.md) you can embed a full featured video player on your webpage without requiring a third-party plug-in or JavaScript.
